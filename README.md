# Internet-of-Models
A few examples of how an internet of models can be deployed where inputs and outputs are shared between every connected model:
The Internet of Models (IoM) is a system of interconnected machine learning models that can be used to improve people's lives in a variety of ways. For example, the IoM can be used to:

Personalize healthcare. By combining the knowledge of multiple healthcare models, the IoM can be used to create personalized treatment plans for patients. This can lead to better outcomes and a more positive patient experience.

Improve financial planning. By combining the knowledge of multiple financial models, the IoM can be used to create personalized financial plans for individuals and families. This can help people to save more money, invest more wisely, and achieve their financial goals.

Make transportation more efficient. By combining the knowledge of multiple transportation models, the IoM can be used to create more efficient transportation systems. This can lead to reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and a better quality of life for everyone.

Protect the environment. By combining the knowledge of multiple environmental models, the IoM can be used to develop more effective ways to protect the environment. This can lead to a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.

These are just a few of the ways that the IoM can be used to improve people's lives. As the IoM continues to develop, we can expect to see even more ways in which it can be used to make the world a better place.

Here are some of the additional technical things that you may eventually be able to do with the IoM:

Improve the performance of machine learning models. By combining the knowledge of multiple models, the Internet of Models can be used to improve the performance of individual models. This is because each model will learn from the strengths of the other models and will be less likely to make the same mistakes.

Reduce the amount of data required to train machine learning models. By sharing data between models, the Internet of Models can be used to reduce the amount of data required to train individual models. This is because each model will only need to learn the parts of the data that it is responsible for.

Make machine learning models more robust. By combining the knowledge of multiple models, the Internet of Models can be used to make machine learning models more robust. This is because each model will be able to compensate for the weaknesses of the other models.

Make machine learning models more interpretable. By combining the knowledge of multiple models, the Internet of Models can be used to make machine learning models more interpretable. This is because each model will be able to provide a different perspective on the data, which can help to explain how the model makes its predictions.
